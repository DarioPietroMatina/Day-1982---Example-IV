    "# Day (1982) Example IV\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "One of the limitations of the Solow model is that growth is not a smooth and continuous process. As a matter of fact, recessions and irregular growth cycles are at the core of the mechanism of economic development. In order to account for such irregularities, Day (1982) takes the theoretical framework developed by Solow and extends it by incorporating into the model insights from the so-called Chaos Theory. As a consequence, oscillating behaviours and chaotic patterns arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the saving rate is no longer exogenous but depends positively on the interest rate such that saving function $s(k)$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(k_t)=q\\Big{(}1-\\frac{c}{r_t}\\Big{)}\\frac{k_t}{y_t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q$ and $c$ are exogenous parameters whereas $r_t$ is the interest rate at time $t$ that, under the assumption of competitive markets and Cobb-Douglas production function, is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_t=\\alpha \\frac{y_t}{k_t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, assume that the law of motion of capital takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{t+1}=\\frac{min [ (1+\\rho) k_{t}, \\ s(k_t)y_t ] }{1+n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the maximal growth rate of capital. Day (1957) proposes several explanations why such a limitation may arise, including behavioural reasons or possible costs of adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "Choose   $k_0$   such that   $k_0<(\\alpha A/c)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}$   otherwise a solution may fail to exist."
